Paradox 0.1.5b is here!
------
**Paradox Version:** 0.1.5b - **[TODO.md](https://github.com/proxikal/DiscordPHPBot/blob/master/TODO.md "TODO.md")**<br><br>
Made installation process a little less painful in **0.1.5b**<br>
Private message the bot: **#join serverlink**<br>
Then you will need to type **#grantchannel Your Server Name**<br>
Fixed some bugs people were having from the startup process.<br>
to install:
------
**[without git]**<br>
After you download the bot to your C:\<yourpath>\Paradox\ folder.<Br>
It should look like this: C:\<yourpath>\Paradox\DiscordPHPBot\<Br>
Now, install composer @ https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe<br><br>
-once completed:
Browse to your **C:\<your path>\Paradox\DiscordPHPBot** Directory.<br>
In windows 7, 8 and I think 10 as well: you can Hold down SHIFT and right click in the folder.<br>
You will see a context menu with a new item - > **open command window here** (click it)<br>
*(or in a command prompt type: cd C:\<your path>\Paradox\DiscordPHPBot)* <br>
Now that the command line is opened in our Work DIR. We can type: `composer install` <br>
*Disregard the errors using this method, the bot still works.*<br>
This bot does not run in a web browser. **ONLY COMMAND PROMPT**.<br>
